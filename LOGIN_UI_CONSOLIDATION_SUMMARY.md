# Login UI Consolidation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Conflicting Login UI**
- The old `Launcher.Init()` method was showing its own programmatic login dialog
- This conflicted with the new XML-based login activity
- Removed all programmatic UI code from `Launcher.java`

### 2. **Simplified Flow**
- `MainActivity` now checks for saved license key
- If key exists: starts Floating service directly
- If no key: starts LauncherLoginActivity
- MainActivity always finishes after starting the next component

### 3. **Consolidated Login Logic**
- All UI is now in `LauncherLoginActivity` with XML layout
- All business logic remains in `Launcher.java`
- Clean separation of concerns

### 4. **Professional UI**
- Updated login layout with BearMod branding
- Black background with white text
- Styled EditText and Button
- Better visual hierarchy

## Current App Flow

1. **App Launch** → MainActivity
2. **Check License** → `Launcher.hasValidKey()`
3. **If Valid Key** → Start Floating service → Show overlay
4. **If No Key** → Start LauncherLoginActivity → User enters key
5. **After Login** → Start Floating service → Show overlay

## Benefits

- No more stuck initialization screen
- Clean, modern login UI
- Proper activity lifecycle management
- No conflicting UI elements
- Better user experience

The app should now flow smoothly from launch to login to overlay!
