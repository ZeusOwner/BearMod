# BearMod Package Overview

This document provides an overview of the Java files located in the `app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/` directory, which appear to constitute the main application or loader components of BearMod.

## Key Files

- **`[MainActivity.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/MainActivity.java)`**:
  - Likely the main entry point for the Android application.
  - Handles the primary user interface and overall application lifecycle.

- **`[Floating.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/Floating.java)`**:
  - Potentially implements a floating UI element, such as a mod menu or an overlay.
  - This could be used to interact with mod features while the target application is running.

- **`[ESPView.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/ESPView.java)`**:
  - Suggests functionality related to ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).
  - This component would be responsible for drawing or displaying information gathered through ESP features.

- **`[Launcher.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/Launcher.java)`**:
  - May handle the initialization and launching of various parts of the BearMod application or the mod itself.
  - Could be involved in setting up the environment before the mod's core functionalities are activated.

- **`[FileUtil.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/FileUtil.java)`**:
  - A utility class providing helper methods for file operations.
  - This might be used for managing configuration files, assets, or downloaded module components.

- **`[RecorderFakeUtils.java](mdc:app/src/main/java/com/bearmod/RecorderFakeUtils.java)`**:
  - Likely contains utilities to bypass or spoof screen recording status.
  - This can be used to prevent the mod or application from being detected by anti-cheat systems that monitor screen recording.

## Relationship to Modular Architecture

These files seem to align with the "Loader App" portion of the "Modular Android Loader Architecture" described in `[Modular Android Loader Architecture (BearMod-Loader)](mdc:.cursor/rules/BearMod-Loader-Architecture.mdc)`. They handle UI, potentially some pre-mod logic, and utilities, before any dynamic mod module is loaded.

Refer to the individual files for detailed implementation.
